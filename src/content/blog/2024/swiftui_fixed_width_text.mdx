While building my [camera app](https://composure.rioogino.com), I had several
UI elements with text labels whose width could change, the most
prominent being the current exposure values (e.g. current ISO, shutter speed):

Although it currently uses percentage-based layouts, I initially relied on
SwiftUI's default behaviors to allocate the proper amount of space to each
sub-view (e.g. auto/manual, label/value pairs). However, I ran into an annoying
problem: as the ISO or shutter speed changed, the **width of the text values
could change, causing a re-layout of the entire exposure view.**

As I did not want to hard-code widths - something that would need to consider
Dynamic Type, screen width and available height, my initial solution was a
`ZStack` with a hidden text view containing the widest text that would be displayed:

```swift
ZStack(alignment: .topLeading) {
  // Widest text that will be displayed
  Text("1/1000s")
    .hidden()

  // The actual shutter speed
  Text("1/5s")
}
.monospaced()
```

Unfortunately, at larger Dynamic Type sizes, the text becomes so large that it
doesn't fit on one line:

Adding `.lineLimit(1)` simply truncates the text:

[`.minimumScaleFactor(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/minimumscalefactor(_:))
allows the text to shrink to fit in the available space. This seemed perfect
until I realized that it gets applied to each text view *independently*:

<BlogVideoPlayer
  baseUrl="/assets/blog/2024/fixed_width_text/zstack_minimum_scale_factor/"
  source={[
    { src: "h264.mp4", type: "video/mp4" }
  ]}
  poster="poster.png"
  description="When the visible text is narrower than the scaled hidden text,
  the visible text does not need to get scaled down, so it is causes the
  ZStack's height to increase. Only when the visible text gets wider does it
  match the scale factor of the hidden text."
  aspectRatio={780/330}
  loop={true}
  controls={false}
/>

While this does succeed in creating a fixed-width view, the height and font
size will still vary with the width of the displayed text. After several
random, half-hearted attempts, I stumbled across the technique of using an
overlay.

In an overlay, the contents are constrained to the size of the parent view
(unless the `.fixedSize` modifier is used). Thus, if `minimiumScaleFactor`
is applied to the hidden text, it will shrink both it and the overlay:

- The hidden text is *width-constrained* (and/or height-constrained)
- Scaling is applied to shrink the hidden text. This reduces the view size in
  *both* dimensions
- The text in the overlay is now *height-constrained*
- Scaling is applied to shrink the overlay text, making the heights match

As the heights match, the scaling factors of the two text views must be equal,
ensuring that the font size of the text always matches that of the hidden.

```swift
Text("1/1000s")
    .hidden()
    .overlay {
        Text("1/5s")
            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity,
                   maxHeight: .infinity,
                   alignment: .leading)
    }
    .lineLimit(1)
    .minimumScaleFactor(0.4)
    .accessibilityLabel("1/5")
```

<BlogVideoPlayer
  baseUrl="/assets/blog/2024/fixed_width_text/overlay/"
  source={[
    { src: "h264.mp4", type: "video/mp4" }
  ]}
  poster="poster.png"
  description="The visible text stays the same size as the 'hidden' (red) text.
  When it reaches its max width, both views are scaled by the same amount to fit.
  The blue text is rendered at the native text size."
  aspectRatio={1060/340}
  loop={true}
  controls={false}
/>

A frame modifier with `alignment` is used to ensure that the text does not get
centered, and finally, an accessibility label is added to ensure that VoiceOver
reads the actual, not hidden text.
